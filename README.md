> This is a script file to house my Ruby Capstone project "Telegram Bot".

## Built With

- Ruby -v2.7.0p0
- Telegram-bot

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Open the terminal and clone the repository with the next commands:
- Clone it with HTTPS using the command `git clone https://github.com/jssarrazolaa/Telegram-Bot.git`.
- Clone it with SSH using the command `git clone git@github.com:jssarrazolaa/Telegram-Bot.git`.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby -v 2.7.x
- Telegram account

### Setup

- Open the terminal
- Go to the root folder of the repository.
- Run the comman `bundle install`
- Run the program with this code: `ruby bin/main.rb`

### Usage

- Follow the instuctions:

- Copy the URL you will see in the terminal and open it in the browser.
- The URL will open a Telegram chat with the bot.
- Enter the command `start` to see how the Bot works.
- Enter `time *country*` to see the current time in that country and the difference with the UTC time.
- Enter `stop` or `exit` to turn off the bot.

### Automated Tests

- In root directory copy this:
            ```
            cd spec
            ```
- In your terminal copy this code to test the methods:
            ```
            rspec enumerable_spec.rb
            ```
- If one of the methods is not working it will show you this error example:

            Failures:

               1) Methods token returns the token
                    Failure/Error: expect(method.token).to be false
                    
                    expected false
                         got #<String:1320> => "1169735408:AAFB1CCrgujdVmwUANIQgS8MTKGvUy4ZrYk"
                    # ./methods_spec.rb:22:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

               Finished in 0.01663 seconds (files took 0.09608 seconds to load)
               3 examples, 1 failure
